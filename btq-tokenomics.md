Bitcoin Quantum has a total supply of 21 million BTQ, allocated for the following purposes. This fixed supply is a strategic choice reflecting the project’s vision to position BTQ as a form of **digital gold,** which is particularly significant in the context of **quantum-resistant technologies**. The fixed and unchangeable supply of BTQ adds scarcity, enhancing its potential value retention over time, thereby making it an attractive asset in an era of rapidly evolving digital security concerns driven by the advances in computing power, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data.

Moreover, BTQ is pioneering in the cryptographic revolution, incorporating core technological advancements such as the **Extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS).** Recognized by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** for its quantum resistance, XMSS is critical as computing power, alongside capabilities in AI and machine learning, continues to expand, leading to potentially disruptive innovations in data processing and analysis. By adopting this advanced cryptographic standard, BTQ ensures robust security and stability for its digital currency, positioning it to effectively navigate and lead in the transforming landscape of cryptography amidst these technological advancements.

## Allocation Details

In this section, we explain the details of each allocation and their purposes.

### **Mining**

The majority of BTQ supply is allocated to mining to ensure the safety and security of the network. These mining rewards encourage miners to contribute processing power, helping to maintain the decentralization and efficiency of the blockchain. We are committed to mining because it is the original vision of Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) by Satoshi Nakamoto that has proven to be a viable method for establishing a digital asset as valuable digital gold. This PoW mechanism not only supports network security through widespread miner participation but also ensures a fair distribution of new coins, reflecting a trust system akin to the mining of precious metals in the physical world.

Additionally, Bitcoin Quantum adopts this approach with a long-term perspective, planning for coin emission over a thousand years. This extended emission schedule is designed to gradually introduce new coins into the system, mimicking the enduring value proposition of gold and other precious metals, which have historically served as long-term stores of value. This slow and steady approach helps to prevent inflation and market saturation, ensuring that BTQ remains a sought-after asset for future generations.

Moreover, the use of PoW in BTQ reflects a commitment to maintaining a decentralized and egalitarian network where anyone with the necessary hardware can contribute to the network's security and coin generation, promoting a level playing field. This method is contrasted with Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, where the rich potentially get richer, centralizing control.

We also see the PoW model as critically aligning with innovations in energy efficiency and the integration of renewable energy sources into mining operations. As the global emphasis on sustainability grows, BTQ's mining infrastructure is poised to adapt to environmentally friendly technologies, thus supporting a green economy while securing the network.

In summary, by aligning BTQ with the proven PoW concept, we are not only adhering to a tested and secure method but are also enhancing it with a vision for long-term emission and sustainability. This approach firmly establishes BTQ as a reliable digital gold of the future, designed to be valuable, secure, and accessible over the next millennium.

### **Foundation**

The BTQ Foundation supports the project's activities, including technology development, network maintenance, and other administrative costs. This funding also supports research initiatives and strategic partnerships.

### **Marketing**

This allocation is used to promote BTQ, including marketing campaigns, community events, and activities aimed at expanding global awareness and usage of BTQ.

### **ICO**

Funds raised from the ICO are used to finance the early stages of project development, including legal fees, technical development, and other startup activities.

## Transparency and Governance

### Use of Pre-Mined Funds

For the pre-mined funds, we commit to maintaining a high level of transparency in how these resources are used. Periodic reports will be published so the community can monitor and evaluate fund management.

### Community Participation

We encourage community involvement in significant decisions related to the project through a voting system and feedback. This ensures the project reflects the majority's will and maintains strong ties with our supporters and users.

## Conclusion

Bitcoin Quantum is a serious endeavor to create a secure, fair, and sustainable cryptocurrency. With a clear and transparent tokenomics strategy, we believe that BTQ will achieve widespread acceptance and become a new standard in the cryptocurrency world.
