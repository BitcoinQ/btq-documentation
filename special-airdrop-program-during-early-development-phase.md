# Special Airdrop Program During Early Development Phase

BTQ not only inherits the stable economic model of Bitcoin but also significantly enhances it by integrating quantum-resistant technology, aiming to become the "digital gold" for the future. BTQ is striving to compete with BTC and other blockchains through technological improvements, particularly in minimizing the risk of hardware centralization. This not only strengthens sustainability but also enhances security, positioning BTQ as one of the leading cryptocurrencies capable of withstanding threats from quantum technology.
