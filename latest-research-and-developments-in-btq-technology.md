# Latest Research and Developments in BTQ Technology

**XMSS: A Post-Quantum Secure Digital Signature Scheme Approved by NIST**

This guidance outlines two digital signature generation methods: the Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) and the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS), including their hierarchical variantsâ€”Hierarchical Signature System (HSS) and multi-tree XMSS. These are stateful hash-based signature schemes recognized for their post-quantum security.

**Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) - RFC 8391 Overview**

BTQ Cryptocurrency is now distinguished as the pioneering industrial application of the XMSS (eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) as specified by the IETF in RFC 8391. You can read the full documentation [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8391).

This document outlines XMSS, a hash-based digital signature scheme derived from scientific literature. It details the operational specifics of Winternitz One-Time Signature Plus (WOTS+), XMSS, and its multi-tree variant, XMSS^MT. All these mechanisms integrate WOTS+ as their core component.

XMSS is recognized for providing robust digital signatures that do not depend on the presumed difficulty of mathematical problems. Instead, its security is grounded on the properties of cryptographic hash functions. This scheme offers strong security assurances, maintaining integrity even if the collision resistance of the underlying hash function is compromised. XMSS is advantageous for its compactness, straightforward implementation, and inherent resistance to side-channel attacks. Notably, unlike many traditional signature systems, hash-based signatures like XMSS remain secure against the potential threats posed by quantum computing.
