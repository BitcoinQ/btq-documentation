# Send BTQ

Sending BTQ (Bitcoin Quantum) using the BTQ Web Wallet is straightforward and secure. Ensure you have access to your wallet using your private recovery keys, that there are sufficient funds in your address, and that you know the public address of the recipient.

## Accessing Your Wallet

Refer to the guide on opening the web wallet with recovery keys to access your wallet.

### Send BTQ

Once your wallet is open, navigate to the "Send & Receive" tab, which is typically the default tab when you open your wallet.

**Required Fields to Send BTQ:**

* **Recipient Address:** Enter a valid BTQ address that will receive the funds.
* **Amount:** Specify the amount of BTQ to send.
* **Fee:** Enter the fee amount for broadcasting the transaction onto the network.
* **OTS Key Index:** Use an unused One Time Signature (OTS) Key to sign the transaction.

**Important:** Keep track of your OTS Key usage. Although the web wallet monitors your OTS key index from the blockchain, it is good practice to record this number after each transaction.

After entering all the necessary information, click the "Confirm" button at the bottom of the form. This will compile and sign the transaction for broadcast to the network.

## Broadcast Transaction

On the following page, verify all transaction details are correct, then click "Click To Send" to transmit the transaction to the BTQ network.

The transaction will spread across the BTQ network and be credited to the recipient's address. Your screen will display the confirmation details as the transaction processes.

### Confirm Transaction

To confirm that a transaction was successfully sent and acknowledged by the network, select the transaction in your wallet's list to view details.

You can also enter the transaction hash or ID into the "Verify Transaction" tab to obtain various data on the transaction, including the number of confirmations (blocks) it has received.

**Example Transaction Hash:** 60a3d4ee64291a0d8c56a3e2092e6f32e7234c943c10d633754c1dd850153365

For additional confirmation, you can visit the BTQ Block Explorer.

### Receiving BTQ

To receive BTQ, simply provide your public address to the sender. You do not need to have the wallet open to receive BTQ.

## **Locate Public Address**

Your public address can be accessed through the BTQ Web Wallet:

* Open your wallet, and the public address will be visible at the top of the "Send & Receive" tab.
* Click the receive tab in the wallet to view your wallet address and a QR code with additional wallet details.

Share this public key with whoever is sending you coins.

**Example Public Key:** Q000400202ea4dc2b83ded8cfcd4fc8c0447ca3391582430cec6b093291ab9773173af1bb5ed7e8

This comprehensive approach allows for secure management and transfer of BTQ assets within the network.
