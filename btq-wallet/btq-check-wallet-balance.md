# BTQ Check Wallet Balance

Checking the balance of a BTQ (Bitcoin Quantum) wallet involves verifying the information directly from the BTQ blockchain, which is the definitive source for all balance details. Each transaction affecting a wallet, whether incoming or outgoing, is permanently recorded on the blockchain.

## How to Check a BTQ Wallet Balance

## **Public Address**

A BTQ public address typically starts with "Q". Here's an example of a BTQ public address: [Q010500f07a209bfa657e526118a9c5e40ecb5f69d3a8da991ddc1fe0269c7ec617f693f362a051](https://explorer.bitcoinq.xyz/a/Q010500f07a209bfa657e526118a9c5e40ecb5f69d3a8da991ddc1fe0269c7ec617f693f362a051). Remember, never use a private key for balance inquiries on explorers or websites, as it could compromise the security of the funds.

## **Balance Lookup Methods**

1. **BTQ Block Explorer**
   * This is the simplest and most straightforward method to check the balance of a BTQ wallet. Just enter the public address into the BTQ Block Explorer to view the current balance and all related transactions.
   * For detailed instructions, refer to the BTQ Block Explorer documentation.
2. **BTQ Wallet**
   * When you open a BTQ wallet and load the secret keys, the balance of the address will display across all available wallet interfaces.
   * It is not recommended to load secret keys merely to check a balance since it poses unnecessary risks. Instead, use the public address in the BTQ Block Explorer for a safer balance lookup.
3. **BTQ Command Line Tools**
   * For those preferring command-line tools, there are multiple methods to check a wallet balance using different commands based on the specific tool.
   * Always use the public key when possible for balance lookups to minimize the risk of exposing secret keys.

By adhering to these methods, you can safely check the balance of your BTQ wallet without compromising your private keys.
