# BTQ Pool Mining

Pool mining with BTQ (Bitcoin Quantum) is the collaborative effort of multiple users who combine their computing resources to achieve greater processing power. Participants share the rewards earned by the pool, proportionate to each miner's contribution.

To engage in BTQ pool mining without syncing the entire blockchain, you can connect to a BTQ mining pool and contribute your hashing power. This method allows you to use virtually any hardware, even without operating a full node.

## RANDOMX

BTQ employs the RandomX algorithm for validating work on the network. More detailed information about RandomX can be found on its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX).

## Mining Pool Information

Important aspects to consider about mining pools:

* There is no official BTQ pool. The development team might only operate a TestNet pool for testing purposes.
* Most pools impose a fee for their services, which typically covers server maintenance and power costs; this fee is determined by the pool.
* Pools may vary in their minimum payout amounts. Always read the terms carefully to ensure you understand the pool's rules.
* It's advisable not to store your BTQ in the pool's wallet. If possible, transfer your earnings to your personal wallet as soon as you reach the minimum payout amount.
* To connect to a pool, you'll need a BTQ wallet address for receiving mining rewards. This address is used as your username for the pool. Additionally, you can track your miner's statistics by entering your wallet address on most mining pool websites.

### Requirements

* A computer for mining
* Mining software compatible with the pool
* A BTQ wallet address for receiving rewards

Mining with both CPUs and GPUs is possible, and the effectiveness of each depends on various factors that are beyond the scope of this guide.

### Mining Software

Download the appropriate mining software for your operating system and follow the setup instructions. Ensure you replace any placeholder with your actual BTQ wallet address.

#### **Example of Mining Software:**

* **XMRig**: Primarily a CLI tool, supports CPU and GPU (NVIDIA & AMD) mining, available for Windows, Linux, and OSX. Features include a guided start, open-source code, TLS support, an HTML statistics page, and a JSON API. Find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig).

_Note: This list is not comprehensive and does not endorse any project. Most RandomX-compatible mining software should work; however, your experience may vary (YMMV)._

Most mining pools provide a "Getting Started" section on their website to assist with the setup. For further support, consider joining the BTQ community chat or forums.

This guide serves as a basic introduction to pool mining for BTQ, tailored for those who prefer not to manage a full node but still wish to participate in mining.
