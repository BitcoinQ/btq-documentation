# How to Swap Tokens on PancakeSwap

### **Prerequisites:**

1. **A Wallet:** You need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC). MetaMask is a popular choice.
2. **BNB for Gas Fees:** Ensure you have some BNB in your wallet to cover the transaction fees.
3. **PancakeSwap Interface:** Access to the PancakeSwap interface at [pancakeswap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance/).

### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Connect Your Wallet:**
   * Go to the [PancakeSwap interface](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap).
   * Click on "Connect Wallet" at the top right corner.
   * Choose your wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask) and follow the prompts to connect your wallet.
2. **Select Tokens to Swap:**
   * In the "Swap" interface, select the token you want to swap from the dropdown menu in the "From" section.
   * In the "To" section, select the token you want to receive.
3. **Enter the Swap Amount:**
   * Enter the amount of the token you want to swap in the "From" field.
   * The corresponding amount of the token you will receive will be automatically calculated and displayed in the "To" field.
4. **Review Transaction Details:**
   * Check the details of the swap, including the exchange rate and any fees.
   * Pay attention to the "Price Impact" and "Minimum received" fields to understand the transaction's impact and ensure you're getting the expected amount.
5. **Adjust Slippage Tolerance:**
   * Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed.
   * Click on the settings icon and adjust the slippage tolerance if necessary. The default is usually 0.5%, but you might need to increase it for more volatile tokens.
6. **Approve Token (if required):**
   * If you are swapping an ERC-20 token for the first time, you will need to approve it for trading.
   * Click "Approve \[Token]" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. This step authorizes PancakeSwap to use your tokens.
7. **Swap Tokens:**
   * After approval, click the "Swap" button.
   * Review the transaction details in the popup and confirm the swap.
   * Confirm the transaction in your wallet to execute the swap.
8. **Transaction Confirmation:**
   * Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Binance Smart Chain. This may take a few seconds to minutes depending on network congestion.
   * You can check the status of your transaction in your wallet or by using a BSC blockchain explorer like [BscScan](https://bscscan.com/).
9. **Check Your Wallet:**
   * Once the transaction is confirmed, the new tokens will be available in your wallet.
   * If the new tokens do not appear immediately, you may need to add the token contract address to your wallet manually.

### Tips and Warnings:

* **Gas Fees:** Binance Smart Chain fees are generally lower than Ethereum, but itâ€™s still good practice to check the current gas prices to choose an optimal time for your transaction.
* **Security:** Ensure you are using the official PancakeSwap interface and be cautious of phishing sites.
* **Slippage:** High slippage tolerance can lead to unexpected losses, especially with low liquidity tokens.

By following these steps, you can easily swap tokens on PancakeSwap. Happy trading! '
