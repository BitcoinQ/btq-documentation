# BTQ Documentation

This resource serves as a comprehensive guide for all aspects of BTQ, from basic usage to advanced development. Whether you're initiating a new project or simply learning the fundamentals, you'll find the necessary information here.

Our documentation is organized into three primary sections: 'Use,' 'Build,' and 'API.' These categories are designed to assist users, developers, and anyone interested in navigating through the BTQ project. Starting with basic functions and progressing to more complex topics like API integration and Extended XMSS HyperTree creation, our aim is to provide clear and useful guidance for all levels of engagement.
